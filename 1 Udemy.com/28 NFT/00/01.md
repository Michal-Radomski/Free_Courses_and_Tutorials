## Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that records transactions securely and transparently across a network
of computers. Each transaction is grouped into a "block," and these blocks are linked chronologically to form a "chain,"
creating an immutable (unchangeable) record of all transactions. This system removes the need for intermediaries like banks,
as it enables secure peer-to-peer transfers and automates processes using smart contracts[1][3]. Blockchain technology
underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend to supply chain management, healthcare
records, and more[1].

## NFT (Non-Fungible Token)

An NFT, or Non-Fungible Token, is a unique digital asset created and managed on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies (which
are fungible, meaning each unit is identical and interchangeable), NFTs are non-fungible—each one is distinct and cannot be
replicated or exchanged on a one-to-one basis with another NFT[3][5][6]. NFTs can represent ownership of digital items such
as artwork, music, videos, virtual real estate, collectibles, or even tokenized physical assets[1][4][5].

NFTs are created through a process called "minting," where digital content is uploaded to a blockchain platform, assigned a
unique identifier, and linked to an owner’s digital wallet[5][6]. The blockchain records the NFT’s ownership and transaction
history, providing transparent proof of authenticity and provenance[3][6][7]. NFT owners can buy, sell, or transfer these
tokens on various online marketplaces, with the blockchain ensuring the security and integrity of each transaction[1][4].

## Key Takeaways

- **Blockchain** is the foundational technology that enables secure, transparent, and decentralized record-keeping[1][3].
- **NFTs** are a specific application of blockchain, representing unique digital assets whose authenticity and ownership are
  verifiable on the blockchain[1][3][5].
- NFTs have revolutionized digital ownership, especially in art, gaming, and collectibles, by allowing creators to monetize
  and prove the uniqueness of their digital works[6][7].
