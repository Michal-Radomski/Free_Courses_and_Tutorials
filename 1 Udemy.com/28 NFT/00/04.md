## Key Differences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum

| Feature                  | Bitcoin (BTC)                       | Ethereum (ETH)                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**              | Digital currency and store of value | Smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps) |
| **Launch Year**          | 2009                                | 2015                                                |
| **Founder(s)**           | Satoshi Nakamoto                    | Vitalik Buterin and others                          |
| **Native Token**         | Bitcoin (BTC)                       | Ether (ETH)                                         |
| **Supply Limit**         | 21 million BTC (fixed)              | No fixed supply cap for ETH                         |
| **Consensus Mechanism**  | Proof of Work (mining)              | Proof of Stake (staking, since 2022)                |
| **Primary Use Case**     | Peer-to-peer payments, digital gold | Platform for DeFi, NFTs, dApps, smart contracts     |
| **Programmability**      | Limited                             | Highly programmable (supports smart contracts)      |
| **Transaction Fees**     | Generally lower                     | Generally higher                                    |
| **Environmental Impact** | Higher (energy-intensive mining)    | Lower (after switch to staking)                     |

### **Purpose and Design**

- **Bitcoin** was created as a decentralized digital currency and a secure store of value, often referred to as "digital
  gold." Its main function is to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries and to serve as a hedge against
  inflation[1][4][5].
- **Ethereum** was designed as a flexible platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and executing smart
  contracts, which are self-executing agreements coded directly onto the blockchain. This makes Ethereum more than just a
  cryptocurrency—it acts as a "world computer" for decentralized finance and other applications[1][2][4][5][7].

### **Technology and Functionality**

- **Bitcoin’s blockchain** is optimized for security and simplicity, focusing on recording transactions and maintaining a
  fixed supply of 21 million coins[1][4].
- **Ethereum’s blockchain** is programmable, allowing developers to create a wide range of applications, including
  decentralized finance (DeFi), games, and NFTs. Its native currency, Ether (ETH), is used to pay for computational services
  and transaction fees[1][2][4][5][7].

### **Consensus Mechanism**

- **Bitcoin** uses Proof of Work (PoW), which requires miners to solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. This process
  is energy-intensive[2][7].
- **Ethereum** started with PoW but transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) in 2022, where validators are chosen to create new
  blocks based on the amount of ETH they hold and are willing to "stake." This method is more energy-efficient[2][7].

### **Monetary Policy**

- **Bitcoin** has a hard cap of 21 million coins, ensuring scarcity[1][4].
- **Ethereum** does not have a fixed supply cap, and its monetary policy can change over time, which some view as less
  predictable[1].

### **Use Cases**

- **Bitcoin** is primarily used as a digital asset for investment or as a medium of exchange[1][2][5].
- **Ethereum** powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and more,
  thanks to its support for smart contracts[2][4][5][6][7].

### **Market Position**

- **Bitcoin** remains the most valuable and widely recognized cryptocurrency, often seen as a safe haven asset in the crypto
  world[2][5].
- **Ethereum** is the leading platform for decentralized applications and has the second-largest market capitalization[2][5].

In summary:  
**Bitcoin** is mainly a digital currency and store of value with a fixed supply, while **Ethereum** is a programmable
blockchain platform enabling a wide range of decentralized applications and smart contracts, with a more flexible monetary
policy and advanced programmability[1][2][4][5][7].
