  applications.
- **Features**:
  - Integrates seamlessly with React's component-based architecture.
  - Supports hooks and context API for managing state and effects in 3D scenes.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for React developers looking to incorporate 3D graphics into their applications without diving deep
  into Three.js's imperative style[4][6].

### drei

- **Purpose**: A collection of useful helpers and abstractions built on top of React Three Fiber.
- **Features**:
  - Provides pre-built components that simplify the use of common Three.js functionalities within R3F.
  - Enhances developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for developers who want to expedite the development process while using R3F[4].

### Spring

- **Purpose**: A library designed for animations in React applications, commonly used alongside R3F for animating 3D objects.
- **Features**:
  - Provides powerful animation capabilities with a simple API that integrates well with React's state management.
- **Use Cases**: Best suited for adding animations to React components, including those rendered with R3F[4].
