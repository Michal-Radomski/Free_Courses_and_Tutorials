In Git, **upstream** and **mirror** are concepts related to remote repositories but serve different purposes:

### **Upstream**

- **Upstream** typically refers to the original repository from which a fork was created. It is used to keep a forked
  repository synchronized with the original project by fetching updates and merging them into the fork[2][3].
- In a broader sense, an upstream can be any remote repository that serves as a source of truth or a parent repository from
  which changes are pulled[1][5].
- To add an upstream remote, you use the command:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
  ```
- Upstream is often used to track changes from the original repository and to contribute back to it by pulling updates and
  pushing changes after merging[2][4].

### **Mirror**

- A **mirror** in Git refers to a complete copy of a repository, where all branches, tags, and commits are replicated.
  Mirrors are often used for backup purposes or to create a read-only copy of a repository.
- To create a mirror, you can use the `--mirror` option with `git clone`:
  ```bash
  git clone --mirror https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
  ```
- Mirrors are updated using `git fetch --all` or `git remote update --prune`, but they are typically not used for active
  development or collaboration like upstreams are.

### **Key Differences**

- **Upstream** is used to track changes from a parent repository and is often used in forked projects.
- **Mirror** is a complete copy of a repository, used for backup or replication purposes.

### **Example Commands**

- **Add an upstream remote:**
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
  ```
- **Fetch updates from upstream:**
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  ```
- **Create a mirror clone:**
  ```bash
  git clone --mirror https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
  ```
- **Update a mirror:**
  ```bash
  git fetch --all
  ```
