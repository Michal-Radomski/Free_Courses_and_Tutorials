## What are npm Monorepos?

An **npm monorepo** is a single version-controlled repository (usually Git) that contains multiple related Node.js projects,
such as applications, libraries, or services. Instead of managing each project in its own repository (multi-repo), all
projects live together in one place. This approach is especially common in larger teams or organizations managing many
interconnected packages or microservices.

### Key Benefits

- **Centralized code management:** All projects and dependencies are managed in one place, simplifying collaboration and
  onboarding[2][3][5].
- **Atomic commits:** Changes that affect multiple packages can be made and committed together, ensuring consistency[3][6].
- **Streamlined dependency management:** Shared dependencies are easier to manage, reducing version conflicts and
  duplication[2][3][5].
- **Easier refactoring:** Large-scale changes across projects can be performed more easily and safely[5][6].
- **Unified CI/CD pipelines:** Testing and deployment workflows can be standardized across all projects[2][5][6].

## How to Create an npm Monorepo

You can create an npm monorepo manually or by using specialized monorepo tools. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview:

### 1. **Manual Setup (Basic npm Workspaces Approach)**

1. **Create a new repository:**

   ```sh
   mkdir my-monorepo
   cd my-monorepo
   git init
   ```

2. **Initialize a root `package.json`:**

   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Add a `workspaces` field to `package.json`:**

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-monorepo",
     "private": true,
     "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
   }
   ```

4. **Create your project structure:**

   ```
   my-monorepo/
     package.json
     packages/
       app1/
         package.json
       lib1/
         package.json
   ```

5. **Install dependencies and manage packages:**
   - Use `npm install` at the root to install and link dependencies across all workspaces.

### 2. **Using Monorepo Tools**

For more advanced needs (e.g., dependency graph management, parallel builds), consider tools like:

- **Nx**
- **Turborepo**
- **Lerna**
- **Yarn Workspaces**
- **pnpm Workspaces**[2]

These tools add features such as enhanced dependency management, caching, and optimized build/test pipelines.

#### Example: Using Nx

```sh
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-monorepo
```

Follow the prompts to set up your monorepo structure.

### 3. **Best Practices**

- Keep the root `package.json` and workspace definitions up to date.
- Use consistent coding standards and shared tooling across all packages.
- Set up unified CI/CD pipelines to test and deploy all packages together[2][3][5][6].

**In summary:**  
npm monorepos consolidate multiple related projects into a single repository, improving collaboration, code sharing, and
dependency management. You can create one using npm workspaces or specialized tools like Nx or Lerna, depending on your needs
and project complexity[2][3][5][6].
