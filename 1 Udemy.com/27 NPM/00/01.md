`npm audit` is a command-line tool provided by the Node Package Manager (NPM) that scans your project's dependencies for
known security vulnerabilities. When you run `npm audit`, it analyzes the packages listed in your `package.json` and
`package-lock.json` files, checks them against a database of reported vulnerabilities, and generates a detailed report. This
report includes the severity of each vulnerability (low, moderate, high, or critical), affected packages, and recommendations
for remediation, such as updating or replacing vulnerable packages[1][2][3][6].

Key features of `npm audit` include:

- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies security issues in both direct and transitive dependencies.
- **Severity Classification**: Categorizes vulnerabilities by their severity to help prioritize fixes.
- **Automated Fixes**: You can use `npm audit fix` to automatically update packages and resolve some vulnerabilities, though
  manual intervention may be necessary for others[2][7].
- **Compliance and Best Practices**: Running `npm audit` regularly helps maintain the security of your project and aligns
  with industry best practices[5].

Regular use of `npm audit` is recommended to keep your Node.js projects secure and up-to-date[1][5][6].

The key difference between `npm audit fix` and `npm update` lies in their purpose and behavior regarding package upgrades:

- **`npm audit fix`** is specifically designed to address security vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. It scans
  for known vulnerabilities and attempts to automatically upgrade only those packages (or sub-dependencies) to non-vulnerable
  versions while respecting semantic versioning (semver) constraints defined in your `package.json`. It may upgrade,
  downgrade, or change versions to stable, secure releases that fix the issues without breaking compatibility by default. It
  runs an `npm install` under the hood to apply these fixes and updates the `package-lock.json` accordingly. For more
  aggressive fixes that may include breaking changes or major version bumps, you can use `npm audit fix --force`. However,
  some vulnerabilities might require manual intervention if they cannot be fixed automatically[1][3][4][5][6].

- **`npm update`** is a more general command that updates the packages listed in your `package.json` to the latest versions
  that satisfy the semver ranges specified there. It does not specifically target security vulnerabilities but rather updates
  dependencies to newer versions available, which may or may not include security fixes. It is used to keep dependencies up
  to date but does not perform vulnerability scanning or selective fixes like `npm audit fix` does.

In summary:

| Feature                          | npm audit fix                                     | npm update                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                          | Fix security vulnerabilities                      | Update packages to latest semver-compatible versions |
| Scope                            | Only vulnerable dependencies                      | All dependencies within semver range                 |
| Version changes                  | May upgrade or downgrade to fix vulnerabilities   | Upgrades to latest allowed versions                  |
| Automatic vulnerability scanning | Yes                                               | No                                                   |
| Risk of breaking changes         | Low by default; can use `--force` for major bumps | Depends on semver ranges                             |
| Updates lock file                | Yes                                               | Yes                                                  |

Thus, use `npm audit fix` to automatically patch security issues, and use `npm update` to generally keep dependencies
current.

References:

- npm audit fix runs `npm install` to upgrade vulnerable dependencies safely, sometimes even downgrading to stable versions
  to fix issues[1][4][5].
- npm update upgrades packages to latest versions allowed by semver, without targeting vulnerabilities[1][5].
- `npm audit fix --force` allows major version upgrades but may break compatibility[5][7].
