`npm audit` is a command-line tool provided by the Node Package Manager (NPM) that scans your project's dependencies for
known security vulnerabilities. When you run `npm audit`, it analyzes the packages listed in your `package.json` and
`package-lock.json` files, checks them against a database of reported vulnerabilities, and generates a detailed report. This
report includes the severity of each vulnerability (low, moderate, high, or critical), affected packages, and recommendations
for remediation, such as updating or replacing vulnerable packages[1][2][3][6].

Key features of `npm audit` include:

- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies security issues in both direct and transitive dependencies.
- **Severity Classification**: Categorizes vulnerabilities by their severity to help prioritize fixes.
- **Automated Fixes**: You can use `npm audit fix` to automatically update packages and resolve some vulnerabilities, though
  manual intervention may be necessary for others[2][7].
- **Compliance and Best Practices**: Running `npm audit` regularly helps maintain the security of your project and aligns
  with industry best practices[5].

Regular use of `npm audit` is recommended to keep your Node.js projects secure and up-to-date[1][5][6].
