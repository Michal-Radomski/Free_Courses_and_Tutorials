## What are peerDependencies?

**peerDependencies** are a special type of dependency in `package.json` used mainly when developing libraries or plugins that
need to work alongside a host package without bundling that host package themselves. They specify that your package is
compatible with a particular version (or range of versions) of another package, but do **not** automatically install that
package. Instead, the responsibility to install and manage the peer dependency lies with the consumer of your package (the
project that installs your package).

### Why use peerDependencies?

- They express a compatibility requirement between your package (often a plugin or extension) and a host package it depends
  on.
- They avoid version conflicts and duplication by ensuring only one version of the shared dependency is installed at the top
  level.
- They help prevent issues caused by multiple versions of the same package loaded simultaneously (e.g., React or RxJS).

### Example

If you write a React component library, you might specify React as a peer dependency:

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "react": "^17.0.0"
}
```

This means your library expects the consuming project to have React installed, and it should be compatible with React version
17.x. Your library will not install React itself, avoiding multiple React versions in the project.

### Behavior in npm versions

- npm v1, v2, and v7 automatically install peer dependencies if not present.
- npm v3 through v6 only warn about missing peer dependencies but do not install them.
- npm v7+ reinstated automatic peer dependency installation by default but can be controlled with flags.

## What is `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`?

The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is used during installation (`npm install`) to tell npm to **ignore peer dependency conflicts
and not automatically install peer dependencies**. This flag reverts npm's behavior to how it worked in versions 3 through 6,
where peer dependencies are not installed automatically and conflicts are ignored.

### When to use `--legacy-peer-deps`?

- When you encounter peer dependency conflicts that prevent installation.
- When you want to bypass strict peer dependency resolution introduced in npm v7+.
- Useful in legacy projects or complex dependency trees where strict peer dependency enforcement causes problems.

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **peerDependencies**           | Declare a package your module needs but expects the host project to install and manage.                          |
| **Purpose**                    | Ensure compatibility with a host package without bundling it, avoiding version conflicts.                        |
| **Installation**               | Not installed automatically in npm v3–6; installed automatically in npm v7+ (unless overridden).                 |
| **`npm i --legacy-peer-deps`** | Installs dependencies ignoring peer dependency conflicts and disables automatic peer installs (legacy behavior). |

- Peer dependencies specify compatibility requirements and avoid duplicate versions in projects, commonly used for plugins or
  libraries like React components or Babel plugins[1][3][5][6].
- `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` disables automatic peer dependency installation and ignores conflicts, reverting to older npm
  behavior to help with installation issues[4].

The command `npm install --force` (or `npm i --force`) tells npm to **force the installation of a package**, overriding
certain checks and validations that would normally prevent the installation[1][2]. This is especially useful in situations
where:

- There are dependency conflicts between packages.
- A package is corrupted or has integrity issues.
- You need to override existing constraints or force the installation of a specific version.

When you use the `--force` flag, npm ignores warnings and potential conflicts, proceeding with the installation regardless.
However, it should be used with caution, as forcing installations can sometimes lead to unstable or unpredictable project
states[1][2].

**Example usage:**

```
npm install express --force
```

This command will install the `express` package even if there are dependency issues or conflicts that would normally block
the installation[1][2].

When comparing `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` and `npm i --force` from a security perspective, **`--legacy-peer-deps` is
generally considered less risky than `--force`**—but both have important caveats.

## Security Comparison

| Flag                 | What It Does                                                                    | Security Implications                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--legacy-peer-deps` | Ignores peer dependency conflicts, reverting to npm v6 behavior.                | Only skips peer dependency checks; leaves other validations intact. Can still introduce outdated or conflicting packages, which may increase vulnerability risk, but is less likely to break or destabilize the project than `--force`[1][6][5]. |
| `--force`            | Forces npm to install packages, ignoring _all_ dependency and integrity checks. | Ignores all errors and warnings, including critical ones (corrupt packages, version mismatches, etc.), potentially leading to broken, unstable, or insecure installations[6]. This makes it riskier than `--legacy-peer-deps`.                   |

## Key Points

- **`--legacy-peer-deps`** only skips peer dependency checks. It is typically used for legacy projects or when strict peer
  dependency enforcement blocks installation. It does not bypass other integrity or security checks, so it is a more
  controlled workaround[6].
- **`--force`** bypasses _all_ checks, including those that protect against known issues, corrupt packages, and major version
  conflicts. This can lead to a highly unstable or insecure project state and should be used only as a last resort[6].

## Additional Security Note

There is a report of a malicious package named `--legacy-peer-deps` (not the npm CLI flag) that contained critical security
vulnerabilities and could compromise your system if installed as a package[3]. This does **not** apply to using the
`--legacy-peer-deps` flag with `npm install`, but you should never install a package literally named `--legacy-peer-deps`.

## Conclusion

> **`npm i --legacy-peer-deps` is more secure than `npm i --force` because it only skips peer dependency checks, while
> `--force` ignores all errors and warnings, increasing the risk of security issues and project instability. However, both
> should be used cautiously and only when necessary, as they can introduce outdated or conflicting dependencies[1][6].**
