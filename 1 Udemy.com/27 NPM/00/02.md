The key difference between `npm exec` and `npx` lies in how they execute packages and their intended use:

## Comparison Table

| Feature              | `npm exec`                                                                                            | `npx`                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose              | Executes binaries from installed packages                                                             | Executes binaries, including remote packages                                            |
| Installation         | Runs locally installed binaries (from `node_modules/.bin`), can fetch if not present with `--package` | Can run packages not installed locally or globally; downloads and runs them temporarily |
| Default Availability | Available in npm v7+                                                                                  | Available with npm v5.2.0+ (as a separate tool, deprecated in npm 7+)                   |
| Syntax               | `npm exec `                                                                                           | `npx `                                                                                  |
| Temporary Install    | Needs `--package` flag to fetch and run a package not installed                                       | Automatically fetches and runs if not present                                           |
| Deprecation          | Preferred in modern npm versions                                                                      | Deprecated in npm 7+, replaced by `npm exec`                                            |

## Details

- **`npx`** was introduced as a package runner to execute Node.js packages without installing them globally. It is ideal for
  one-off scripts or trying out packages, as it automatically downloads and runs the package if it's not already
  installed[1][2][5][6].
- **`npm exec`** is the modern replacement for `npx` starting from npm v7. It executes binaries from your projectâ€™s
  dependencies or, with the `--package` option, can fetch a package temporarily and run it, similar to how `npx`
  works[2][5][6].
- **Use Case**: Use `npx` for quick, one-off executions, especially if you are using npm v6 or earlier. Use `npm exec` for
  the same purpose in npm v7 and above; it is the recommended approach moving forward[2][5][6].

**Example Usage:**

- `npx create-react-app my-app` (downloads and runs `create-react-app` if not installed)
- `npm exec --package=create-react-app create-react-app my-app` (npm v7+, does the same as above)

In summary, `npm exec` is the modern, preferred command for executing package binaries, replacing most use cases of `npx` in
recent npm versions[2][5][6].
